{"title": "Mission (nearly) accomplished", "tag": null, "content": "As Nepal mourned its dead in the September violence and public buildings smouldered, former Chief Justice Sushila Karki was installed as prime minister to pull the country back from the brink.\nShe gave herself six months to conduct elections, and has gone about achieving that goal with a single-minded sense of purpose. Supporters praise her poise and decisiveness, while others fault her for not pursuing justice for the death and destruction, and postponing the release of the inquiry commission yet agvain.\nBut that also highlights her steadfastness to hold free, fair and peaceful elections on 5 March, and not allow it be derailed by distractions. It has not been easy for the 73-year-old \u2014 she has had to balance radical calls for scrapping the Constitution while appeasing entrenched leaders of established parties.\nKarki has displayed patience, determination, foresight, and, above all, a deep love for country. It has been a lonely struggle, no doubt.\nThe very youth who voted for her on Discord demanded her resignation, \u00a0she had to cajole discredited leaders to take part in polls, and she was not dismayed when her chosen ministers abandoned the government to contest polls. And this is not to mention geopolitical demands that must be happening behind the scenes.\nThis being Nepal, there is endless speculation about who is \u2018pulling the strings\u2019. Yet her record both as chief justice and interim prime minister offer ample evidence of integrity and principled leadership.\nRegardless of geopolitical interpretations of her intentions, Karki is a Nepali leader through and through who has lifted herself from the highest judicial office to the highest executive position, adhering to both mandates.\nOrganising national elections within five months was a formidable task, which many doubted \u2014 and are still doubting \u2014 can be accomplished. Karki has worked closely with the Election Commission, security forces, and mainstream political parties to ensure participation.\nIn doing so, she has set an example not only for Nepal but for South Asia. Bangladesh, which went through its own GenZ protest in 2024 and held elections on Thursday offers a study in contrast. The Awami League and its exiled prime minister who was deposed have been banned from front contesting, there is growing influence of the Jamaat-e-Islami-led alliance.\nHer first address to the National Assembly on 2 February was characteristically candid. She laid out the facts sequentially and emphasised Nepal\u2019s most urgent priority: holding elections on schedule and transferring authority to elected representatives. Timely election was the only constitutional path forward, she said.\nShe acknowledged that GenZ activists had pressured her to appoint certain individuals to her Cabinet. She had to personally persuade Kulman Ghising, Mahabir Pun, and Jagdish Kharel to join her Cabinet. Others she was advised to induct turned out to have controversial pasts, and she was forced to rescind the nominations. She admitted Pun resigned as education minister because he could not get legislative proposals passed.\nEducated, professionally accomplished, known for her frugal lifestyle, Karki has distanced herself from the culture of excess often associated with power, and has turned down multiple invitations for foreign junkets.\nHer meeting with editors at Baluwatar in December was a breath of fresh air for Nepal\u2019s jaded journalists used to excessive displays of power and pomp. Her frankness about threats from the GenZ and pressures from disgraced party leaders drew gasps.\nIn the last five months, Karki has attempted to restore a sense of governance anchored in constitutional duty rather than partisan ambition. But Nepal\u2019s problems have been decades in the making, and it would be unrealistic to expect an interim government to solve all of them at once.\nNepal now stands at a crucial juncture. Leadership alone cannot safeguard democracy, elections alone do not guarantee legitimacy. That must come from delivery, performance and accountability. Citizens casting informed votes on 5 March will determine whether Karki\u2019s handover to leaders capable of placing national interest above party and personal agendas.\nIn a region where democratic transitions often falter, Nepal has another chance to demonstrate that home-grown movements, constitutional discipline, and principled leadership can coexist.\nWhether this moment becomes a turning point depends not only on one leader, but on the collective resolve of the nation and polity.\nWatch a timelapse video of how Anup Tamu drew this portrait of Sushila Karki,here.", "url": "https://nepalitimes.com/news/mission-nearly-accomplished", "scraped_at": "2026-02-13T21:53:23.629612"}
{"title": "International law meets an age of impunity", "tag": null, "content": "On 26 January, the UN Security Council convened a high-level open debate on \u201cReaffirming International Rule of Law.\u201d Chaired by Somali President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud and featuring briefings from Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres and former International Court of Justice (ICJ) judge Abdulqawi Yusuf, the session was Somalia\u2019s signature event during its return to the Council presidency after more than five decades.\nThe timing could hardly have been more fraught. Three weeks earlier, the United States launched Operation Absolute Resolve in Venezuela, capturing President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro from his compound in Caracas. The Trump administration described the operation as a law-enforcement action. Legal scholars and international institutions, however, have widely characterised it as a violation of Article 2(4) of the UN Charter, which prohibits the use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state. Venezuelan officials reported that at least 40 people were killed in the immediate aftermath, with later estimates placing the toll significantly higher.\nAt the same time, the war in Gaza continues under the shadow of the ICJ\u2019s January 2024 provisional measures order, issued two years earlier, requiring Israel to take steps to prevent acts falling within the scope of the Genocide Convention. Whether those measures are being met remains deeply contested. No effective enforcement mechanism exists.\nA further complication emerged in December 2025, when Israel formally recognised Somaliland as an independent state. The decision directly challenges Somalia\u2019s territorial integrity. The Security Council convened an emergency session on 29 December. Most members warned that Israel\u2019s move risked destabilising the Horn of Africa and weakening long-standing principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity.\nSomalia\u2019s concept note for the debate was unusually candid. It argues that repeated breaches of international law in recent armed conflicts have fostered a perception that the international rule of law is being eroded, and warns that this perception fuels distrust and contributes to the gradual weakening of international legal norms. Its references to \u201cselective accountability\u201d were not rhetorical flourishes, but reflections of a political reality many states now recognise.\nThis framing points to a deeper problem. The crisis is not simply that powerful states violate international law; that has always been true. The more serious development is that such violations are increasingly treated as normal, while the institutions meant to restrain them remain unable to respond.\nOne issue quietly underpinning the debate is enforcement by the International Court of Justice. Article 94 of the UN Charter allows a party to seek Security Council recourse when an ICJ judgment is not complied with. The Court has issued binding provisional measures in both the South Africa v. Israel and Ukraine v. Russia cases. In both, the applicant states argue that the measures have not been implemented, a view widely shared among legal observers.\nMember states disagree over whether Article 94 applies only to final judgments or also to provisional measures. But this legal argument misses the central point. Even if the Council accepted that enforcement authority exists, the veto ensures that action against any permanent member, or against close allies, is effectively off the table.\nThis is why debates about the rule of law cannot be separated from the structure of the Security Council itself. As long as some states are shielded from accountability while others are exposed to it, the international legal order will struggle to command legitimacy.\nFor Somalia, convening this debate carried particular weight. President Mohamud assumed the Council presidency while his country faces a direct challenge to its territorial integrity from a state that has repeatedly escaped meaningful Council pressure. In that context, concerns about selective accountability read less like theory than experience.\nThe discussion also reflected Africa\u2019s long and uneven encounter with the international legal system. Conflicts in Sudan, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and elsewhere continue to claim lives while receiving inconsistent attention from the Council. Judge Yusuf\u2019s participation was a reminder that legal authority and expertise are not confined to Western capitals. The African Union\u2019s engagement pointed to a broader push for a legal order that reflects a genuinely multipolar world.\nSomalia circulated a draft presidential statement on 17 January. It was withdrawn five days later, once US opposition became clear. Any language that might have constrained US freedom of action\u2014whether in Venezuela, in its support for Israel, or elsewhere\u2014was unlikely to survive negotiations.\nThe concept note\u2019s guiding questions were serious and well chosen. What strategies might address threats to the rule of law? What steps could slow or reverse its erosion? Which underused provisions of the Charter could be brought back into play? Answering these questions honestly, however, requires recognising that the veto is not a technical flaw awaiting correction. It is a political instrument, designed to preserve the freedom of action of the powerful.\nThe debate took place at a moment when even the meaning of the \u2018rule of law\u2019 is contested. For some states, it demands accountability for Israeli actions in Gaza or US actions in Venezuela. For others, it means defending Ukraine\u2019s territorial integrity against Russian aggression. For still others, it is primarily about protecting sovereignty from external interference.\nWhen the same states invoke legal principles to condemn adversaries while carving out exceptions for themselves and their allies, those principles cease to function as law and become tools of power. As the eightieth anniversary of the UN Charter prompts reflection on whether the post-war international order can endure its current strains, the Council\u2019s debate offered little reassurance. What it did offer was clarity: without confronting the structural privileges that enable impunity, appeals to the rule of law will continue to ring hollow.\nJordan Ryanis a member of the Toda International Research Advisory Council (TIRAC) at the Toda Peace Institute, and former UN Assistant Secretary-General with extensive experience in international peacebuilding, human rights, and development policy.\nThis article was issued by the Toda Peace Institute and has been republished fromthe originalwith permission.", "url": "https://nepalitimes.com/opinion/international-law-meets-an-age-of-impunity", "scraped_at": "2026-02-13T21:53:25.894002"}
{"title": "Map land", "tag": null, "content": "One aspect of colonial cartography of South Asia leaps out in this must-see exhibition \u2013 while the coastline of India, Ceylon, Burma are extraordinarily accurate in maps made more than 200 years ago, the Himalayan hinterland is wholly approximate and inexact.\nThe accuracy improves as modern survey techniques are introduced by atlas-makers, but even then formidable terrain and forbidden lands thwart precision.\nMap aficionados will be fascinated by the 40 antique maps from The Rajbhandari Collection on display at the exhibition \u2018Imaging South Asia: Nepal in the Making at Kathmandu Art Gallery\u2019 at Baber Mahal Revisited from 13 February - 17 March.\nThe first maps were made on clay tablets and cave paintings, but maps improved with Chinese maritime charts of Southeast Asia and beyond. Nautical maps created during the European Age of Exploration used geometry, latitude and longitude.\nCompetition for colonial riches rested on the accuracy of these maps. The Portuguese had the lead in the 15th century, but were soon overtaken by the Spanish with Columbus voyaging to India but landing up in the Americas.\nEuropean mapping of the coastline of peninsular India \u00a0began after Vasco de Gama sailed around the Horn of Africa to arrive at what is now Kerala in 1498.\nThe British and French struggled for control of India, and the Carnatic Wars of the 19th century were extensions of their rivalry in Europe.\nWhile most of the maps at this exhibition were commissioned by the East India Company and the Survey of India, there are quite a few made by Parisian cartographers and feature Pondicherry and the Danish trading outpost at Tranquebar.\nFollowed chronologically, the maps show improvements in cartographic techniques. The earliest French map L\u2019Inde of J D Barbi\u00e9 du Bocage from 1760 is a copper engraving with hand painted colours demarcating boundaries. \u2018Napaul\u2019, \u2018Gorka\u2019 and \u2018Catmando\u2019 are depicted.\nThe rivers of India are precisely drawn, as is the Brahmaputra (Yarou Tsanpou) even though locations across the rest of Tibet are rough estimates.\nThe 1781 map Carte des Indes en de\u00e7\u00e0 et au-del\u00e0 du Gange of Rigobert Bonne has slightly more detail about Nepal with even \u2018Pattan\u2019 and \u2018Bagmally\u2019 river marked. William Darton\u2019s 1802 map has \u2018Nogarcot\u2019 and \u2018Mocaumpour\u2019 wrongly placed to the east of the valley of \u2018Napaul\u2019.\nSamuel Arrowsmith\u2019s 1828 map \u2018India and the Birman Empire\u2019 has Nepal\u2019s rough boundaries demarcated for the first time within a hand-coloured green border, with the mountain \u2018Dholagiri\u2019 and \u2018Dhunchi\u2019 appearing for the first time.\nThe 1835 map by Boston-based American cartographer Thomas Bradford has a more precise \u2018Burrampooter\u2019 river with \u2018Sgigatoe\u2019, \u2018Lassa\u2019 and \u2018Bootan\u2019 marked. In Nepal, \u2018Batgan\u2019, \u2018Macwampour\u2019 and \u2018Lelit Pattan\u2019 appear near \u2018Catmandu\u2019.\nOne striking landmark appears consistently through a century of map-making from 1760 onwards, and that is the sacred Yamdrok Tso near Lhasa. It is precisely located, although it is drawn as a circular lake called \u2018Jamdro or Palto Lake\u2019 till J Bartholomew\u2019s lithographic map in 1893 Constable\u2019s Hand Atlas of India.\nBartholomew\u2019s map is also where \u2018Mt Everest\u2019 appears for the first time with its altitude \u201929,002ft\u2019 after Peak XV was calculated to be the highest mountain in the world by the Survey of India. Meanwhile, \u2018Kinchinjunga\u2019 appears in some of the earlier maps from the mid-1800s, north of \u2018Dorjeloo\u2019.\nThe maps did not only have locations of towns, rivers and mountains but also other interesting facts about places. History buffs will find much to pore over in these maps.\nMany have sites of major British battles while conquering India. The \u2018British India\u2019 map by J Rapkin has dates and times of the \u2018Principle Massacres\u2019 during the Indian Mutiny of 1857.\nThe map also shows India\u2019s growing railway network with completed lines and those \u2018in progress\u2019. Narrow gauge lines can be seen in successive maps snaking up to the Nepal border to haul sal logs for sleepers for India\u2019s expanding railway network.\nMany maps were drawn by British military intelligence. One even has the Kuti route of the Nepal Army while invading Tibet in 1791, and the Chinese Army\u2019s advance in hot pursuit through Kerung to Nuwakot.\nPre-1857 maps show the western Tarai as a part of British India, but in later ones the Naya Muluk districts of Banke, Bardia, Kailali and Kanchanpur have reverted back to Nepal.\nThe maps clearly mark Nepal as an independent nation, and represent it differently from Indian princely states. The Atlas of India of 1846 shows the \u2018Dominion of the King of Nepal\u2019.\nVisitors will be curious about Nepal's claim to Limpiyadhura and Lipu Lek. A map by Mason & Payne from 1846 clearly shows the \u2018Kallee River\u2019 as being the border between Nepal and British India, with Kalapni within Nepal. The Lipu Gad tributary (which India claims is the border) is not marked.\nSome other maps, however, seem to show the border not following the Kali river to Limpiyadhura but the tributary up to Lipu Lek.\nImaging South Asia: Nepal in the Making\nKathmandu Art Gallery, Baber Mahal Revisited\n13 February \u2013 17 March\nFor guided walk-throughsand curatorial tours: +977 1-5318048Panel discussions:\n-Cartographic Practices from the \u00a0Gorkha Polity to the Present\nwith Buddhi Narayan Shrestha and Kanak Mani Dixit\nFriday, 13 February, 4pm-Mapping Beyond Borders\nwith Akhilesh Upadhyay and Amish Raj Mulmi\nWednesday, 25 February, 4pm", "url": "https://nepalitimes.com/review/map-land", "scraped_at": "2026-02-13T21:53:28.146404"}
{"title": "Regenerative conservation from zoologists in Nepal", "tag": null, "content": "If nature is left entirely unmanaged, ecological succession will proceed in ways that may undermine conservation objectives. For example, grasslands and wetlands in the lowland protected areas of Nepal have increasingly been overtaken by excessive vegetation growth.\nWithout intervention, grasslands become taller, denser, and coarser, eventually becoming unpalatable to herbivores. Over time, such areas provide shelter and cover but are gradually succeeded by forest. Similarly, wetlands become silted, and open water surfaces are covered by native and invasive plant species.\nWhile this may provide cover, it reduces accessibility for several species to graze or browse and limits hunting opportunities for predators. These habitats effectively become ecological \u2018blankets\u2019, unfavorable to both prey and predators. Therefore, large herbivores in protected areas are forced to move beyond protected areas in search of succulent forage during lean seasons.\nStalking the prey, predators come closer to human settlement. Farmers in Nepal\u2019s mountains are leaving agriculture due to crop depredation by monkeys, porcupine and wild boars. Trees are taking over the terraces providing habitat for wildlife.\nRestriction and absence of youth in villages for fuelwood collection, fodder harvesting, grazing, and timber extraction in forests have contributed to accumulation of combustible forest litter. Higher up, the absence of grazers leads to the disappearance of forb, dominance of grasses, leading to wildfires.\nNepal has over 300 days of sunshine, and this dries our vegetation faster. Combined with global warming and strong wind in spring, this has sparked widespread and uncontrolled forest fires in recent decades, destroying biodiversity.\nLow-intensity surface fires in late winter can control invasive species and stimulating new plant growth, providing forage for herbivores during lean periods. In contrast, crown fires occurring from March onwards when temperature and wind speed are higher, cause severe damage to wildlife, decimating nesting birds, insects, reptiles, mammals, as well as human life and property.\nSuccessful conservation therefore requires strategies to accommodate increasing wildlife populations by ensuring adequate food, water, and shelter within the protected areas and buffer zones. Without such measures, the increased populations spillover into surrounding habitats, corridors, and farmlands and inevitably damage standing crops, human injury or death, and may result retaliatory killings.\nEfforts are under way for optimising grassland and wetlands. However, more need to be done to upscale harvest to rain water for food security, biodiversity conservation, to fight climate change and to recharge ground water.\nRetaliatory poisoning or electrocution become more frequently reported. Tiger, leopard and wild elephants are primary cause of human fatalities in buffer zones. Recently Himalayan black bears destroyed standing crops and attacked people. Growing tiger population tends to disperse and establish new territories beyond their natal area, bringing them closer to human activity or vice versa.\nHuman life must remain paramount in conservation, and addressing human concerns is essential for sustainable and long-term conservation outcomes. Limited areas could support only certain number animals of certain megafauna, one must determine the numeric as an indicator for management, minimum viable population, and the limit of carrying capacity.\nIt is hard to revive an endangered population, but what goes up must come down, and in the meantime, there should be a strategy to retain, relocate, deter, contain, or control the population, to safeguard human and crops for food security.\nDespite Nepal\u2019s rich biodiversity and ecosystem services, the country generates limited revenue from biodiversity conservation. Although forest cover exceeds 45%, timber imports remain high, reflecting a negative economic growth. If mature timber is not harvested it become susceptible to fire hazard, emitting carbon.\nMore than 23% of Nepal\u2019s land area lies within protected areas, yet only a few derive enough ecotourism revenue. Other protected areas receive very few visitors. Limited entrance access to the protected areas also deprives many outlying communities of tourism economy. It is limiting benefits to local communities despite provisions allowing up to 50% of revenue to be allocated to buffer zone communities.\nDhorpatan Hunting Reserve stands out as a successful revenue model, generating high income from low number of visitors through high-value hunting tourism. Hunting permits are auctioned annually, with fees of approximately $6,000 for Himalayan tahr and $5,000 for blue sheep.\nThere are no plans to establish new hunting reserves like Dhorpatan despite the growing demand for high-value tourism products. International examples, such as Pakistan\u2019s Astore Markhor, which has fetched bids exceeding $370,000, per animal demonstrates the economic potential of regulated trophy hunting.\nIn Africa, surplus megafauna is hunted to control the population, thereby contributing to national economy and safeguarding ecology, and reducing human wildlife conflict. While US is heavily reliable in hunting, fishing and outdoor activities. They determine annual quota for various wildlife and birds.\nConservation priorities should emphasise safeguarding ecologically important species, including predators, scavengers, rodent controllers, insectivores, pollinators, seed dispersers, and aerial feeders that regulate growing populations. Economically important wild fish, reptiles, game birds, game mammals, and edible mollusks should be studied for science-based, seasonal, and quota-regulated harvesting from designated areas. High-value species should be identified, protected, and sustainably harvested to generate revenue through premium tourism.\nThe introduction of Russian wild boar in 1976 in Nagarjun and Shivpuri has led to range expansion and significant crop damage has been reported across the central Mahabharat region. Similarly, rhesus monkey populations cause substantial agricultural losses in many hill villages.\nAlthough the government has declared both as pest species, ambiguous regulations have hindered effective population control. Allowing licensed harvesting of invasive Russian wild boar, for example, could create opportunities for farm-based tourism, enhance food security, and generate revenue and reverse the migration of people to rural areas.\nThe sarus crane is an aesthetically iconic species, with lifelong pair bonding, and cultural significance. In many agricultural landscapes, particularly in South Asia, the sarus crane is informally protected by farmers who recognise its ecological and cultural value. Farmers often tolerate crop damage, and refrain from harming nesting pairs, and in some cases actively safeguard nests and chicks. Such community-led stewardship reflects a harmonious coexistence between agriculture and biodiversity conservation. This may not be a case for other species.\nScience-based research is urgently needed to assess the impacts of pest species on agriculture, apiculture, fisheries, poultry, and livestock, and to develop effective control strategies that also support income generation. Even charismatic and iconic species may require management interventions once populations exceed ecological or social thresholds and begin causing human losses.\nVarious stringent regulations are in place for culprits, however, there should be legal provision for economic incentive to support livelihood from the common, or pest species for the indigenous and people living in remote areas.\nLessons from African models, where problem animals are auctioned and their revenues support conservation and community compensation, could offer viable solutions. The National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act of 1973 provide legal provisions for hunting game mammals, game birds, pest species, and problem animals. And for wildlife farming, but it must be complimented by qualified Zoologists. Problem species are defined as individual or a population of animals posing direct threats to human life and food security within specific areas.\nNepal could categorise wild animals for management and conservation and regulations. For instance, IUCN and globally and NPWC Act protected species, nationally endangered and ecologically important animals and trophy hunting species could be regulated under DNPWC and federal government.\nProvincial governments could take the responsibility of conservation, do inventory and monitor and regulate the harvest of peripheral game species, pest/vermin species and control of problems and harmful to human and crops and health related species. Small predators such as marten, civets, jungle cats and jackals are a nuisance to poultry farmers and goat farmers.\nA nationwide zoological survey could classify species based on abundance, rarity, economic value, pest status, and conservation priority. There should be an opportunity to include hybridisation with wild stocks to improve domestic breeds, such as wild arna with domestic water buffalo, bison with cattle, and red jungle fowl with domestic chickens.\nMonitoring the zoonotic diseases is another field of importance, including Covid-19, Nipah virus, avian influenza, avian cholera, foot-and-mouth disease, swine fever, parvovirus, canine distemper and rabies\u2014to reduce risks to public health and protect the national economy.\nProducing forensic Zoologists is increasingly important for identifying illegally traded species to determine the species and produce evidence to sentence the culprits.\nMonitoring bird diversity and fauna in airports is an important task for zoologists to reduce, deter or prevent birds and wildlife hazards in the airport, aircraft and passengers\u2019 safety. International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) provides guidelines to induct ornithologists to keep the records to bird strike in the planes and deter birds and wildlife in the airports.\nIf Nepal effectively utilises the expertise of zoologists in all tiers of government in species research, population dynamics, and ecotourism planning, it could strengthen biodiversity conservation while generating revenue and supporting economic development.\nOver the past five decades, the Central Department of Zoology at Tribhuvan University has produced more than 2,000 MSc graduates. However, very few have been absorbed into government, with most employed in education, pursuing alternative careers, or emigrating.\nIn contrast, graduates in forestry, botany, microbiology, and environmental sciences have secured greater representation in government roles. The Department of Zoology must evolve to meet modern demands with applied research, wildlife management, and revenue-oriented conservation strategies aligned with the regenerative nature of fauna.\nRajendra N.

{"title": "Dreaming in phases", "tag": null, "content": "This is the 83rd episode of Diaspora Diaries, a Nepali Times series in collaboration with Migration Lab providing a platform to share experiences of living, working and studying abroad.\nSpain is regularising over 500,000 undocumented workers, and Nepalis come to me inquiring about the program. Those who benefit from it will be very lucky, as it is a life-changing opportunity.\nI know because I too benefited from the last large scaled regularisation program back in 2005. I left Nepal in 2000 and went to Germany, Belgium, France before landing in Spain. Things were pretty bad in Nepal back then with the Maoist conflict and strikes.\nOur business was impacted. There was not much hope. When you leave Nepal, you want to make something of yourself and support your family back home. But you have to dream in phases.\nThe first dream is to get \u2018kagaj\u2019 or a temporary residence card (TRC). Only then can you focus on your actual dreams. Whether it was because the countries I traveled were not a good fit or because the chances of getting the document was low, I kept country hopping until I reached Spain in 2004. I have not left since.\nIn Spain, I felt at home. The European dream had brought me here, salaries were higher than Gulf which I thought was too strict. Then there was the possibility of traveling to seven European countries back then with the Schengen visa.\nBut mostly, I just wanted a secure life for me and my family. What I valued the most about Europe was free healthcare and education. This is very important because in other parts of the world including Nepal, people from our background are just one small disease away from losing half our capital and we spend a significant amount of money on educational expenses.\nNepali dais back then told me it would be best to go to either Italy, Spain or Portugal if we wanted to establish ourselves as paper work was relatively easier there than in other European countries. My initial days in Spain without the paper work were difficult. Not concerns about being raided or deported because if we had our apartment, even police let us be.\nBut it was because of unfair pay. You could not go home. It made you tense and irritable. It affects your mental well-being. Some are smart enough to invest time in skills as they wait that will prove useful.\nOthers get depressed. The main reason we migrate is to support our family and when you cannot do it properly and are uncertain about when things will get better, it bothers you. This happened to me too, sometimes I would be staring at the TV and would flinch when other Nepalis asked me what is wrong, and why I look so lost.\nThe newspaper Canariasalso interviewed us about our conditions (pictured). I had not gone home since five years, and there was no way to. There was no social media like now to talk to family. Calling home from booths was expensive, just once every three weeks. You did not talk. It was just to hear voices, pass the phone around to say a quick hello.\nWhen you are undocumented, you don\u2019t get fair wages. But you make that sacrifice because my bigger goal was to establish myself and in the meantime, to support family with whatever I could earn with my wages.\nAll we could do was wait for a regularisation program to open. When Spain initiated such a program in 2005, we were so relieved. We were relatively new so did not understand the language. Other Nepalis guided us and were well-versed in the latest updates via news and consultation with immigration lawyers which they would pass on to us.\nThis time, the regularisation program will come through within 30 days, but back then it took time. I had to wait for nine months. Those nine months felt like nine years. I would keep visiting the cyber caf\u00e9 to check my online status. When friends got their notification, I would get even more anxious and wonder if I would get rejected. Maybe today? Maybe tomorrow?\nIt was a long wait. I wanted to know what it felt like to hold the card in my hand. Then I could hold my five-year-old baby back in Nepal in my hand. She was born after I left for Europe.\nWhen I finally got it after nine months, I could not be happier. I informed my family. I thanked God. Even when I was having food, I would put the card right in front of me on my table. Food never tasted better, I would eat twice the amount with happiness. It was a different kind of elation \u2014 it opened the doors for me to think about my dreams, my targets and how to realise them.\nThere was no stopping me now, I was going to go far. But mostly, I could go home.\nIn that flight back to Nepal after six years my heart swelled and I knelt on the tarmac to pay respect to my motherland. The minute I saw my parents, I touched their feet for blessings. My wife and I cried. My daughter was scared of me and would run away - it took some time for her to get comfortable with my presence. I still break down when I think about it.\nA few trips to Nepal later, I brought my family to Spain after I had fulfilled various rules for family migration. As expenses rise for a migrant, the choice is to either work extra hours or start your own business. Since I got the TRC, I have done it all: various jobs, businesses from selling handicraft from India to a cyber cafe, and the restaurant business.\nAs an entrepreneur, I have seen highs when I could open a second restaurant branch or earn enough to buy an apartment. I have seen lows where I closed down businesses and sold apartment. I have gone from an entrepreneur to a wage job to recoup the losses I made by working extra hours. When I felt comfortable enough, I have gone back to starting a new business.\nI have met wonderful people who have supported me when I started my business either by providing me financial help or as business partners. I have been duped by my own business partner or worked with colleagues who did not want me to prosper. I now run a handicraft shop, an Indian restaurant and a caf\u00e9. The struggle never ends.\nThere are many Nepalis like me who are running businesses here and have bought property. Back in 2004, Nepalis were mostly working in jobs and for a slight salary bump, we would keep switching jobs. Now, they run their own businesses and have bought property. The power of honesty and hard work that Nepalis are known for helps in businesses.\nMalaga is incredibly beautiful and reminds me of Thamel. The brilliant weather and beautiful beaches attracts tourists. The houses are kept small to preserve the culture and civilisation.\nI miss Nepal. I especially miss my father who passed in 2020. He was my biggest cheerleader as I struggled thousands of miles away, and always reminded me that he was here for back support. My mother reminds me to keep at it without worrying.\nSometimes I ask myself, what did I leave behind to earn money and provide a good life to my family? I regret not getting to spend more time with my father before he died. I am not sure what would have happened if I had not left Nepal, but I would have figured something out. Whatever determination I have shown in Spain to navigate my life here, I would have used it back home, too.\nI have missed important milestones like weddings, births, deaths and festivals. I have missed it all.\nOf my three daughters I missed the births of the first two in Nepal. I was only there for my youngest\u2019s birth, in Spain.\nThe regularisation program from 2005 that allowed me to raise the living standards of a number of living around me and reunite with my family. This platform was life changing for me, and my loved ones.\nThere are many Nepalis who will be applying for the 2026 regularisation program if they meet the criteria like presence in the country for at least five months before December 31, 2025. Other European countries have tightened their policies so many Nepalis are in Spain. This is a great opportunity for Nepalis. There are many more undocumented workers than the available quota, a majority from Latin America in Spain who want to benefit.\nThe Nepali diaspora is helping raise awareness and provide accurate information about the processes so they can benefit and no one is left out.

{"title": "Rhinos hit the ground running", "tag": null, "content": "Nepal pushed England all the way to the end in their opening match at the T20 World Cup 2026, ultimately losing by four runs chasing 185.\nLokesh Bam and Karan KC were at the pitch needing 10 off the last over, from at one point needing 60 off the last 30. An ice-cold Sam Curran gave nothing away.\nIt was a game appreciated at home and at the stands in Mumbai\u2019s Wankhede Stadium, where an audience of almost 17,000 Nepalis turned up to cheer for the team.\nPost-game, Nepal have now earned the respect of the cricketing world, and the team can take a lot of confidence going into their three remaining group games against Italy, The West Indies, and Scotland.\nNepalI offer my services to you if you ever need em!Up, up and UP!\nEngland won the toss and chose to bat first at the batter-friendly Wankhede.\n\u201cWe feel like the pitch is going to be in the best shape in the first innings,\u201d England captain Harry Brooks said ahead of the match.\nMuch like Nepal, the England team has a lot of all-rounders and bat deep.\nOpeners Phil Salt and Jos Buttler are currently the second and third best T20 batsmen as ranked by ICC. With Salt out for 1 off 2, and Buttler a modest 26 off 17, there is almost a sense that England underscored.\nJacob Bethell\u2019s 55 off 35, Harry Brook\u2019s 53 off 32, and crucially, Will Jacks\u2019 39 off 18 finishing knock propelled the English score to 184.\nHighlights in the Nepali bowling included spinner Sher Malla\u2019s wicket of Salt off his debut ball, although he went for fourteen in the rest of his over. Sandeep Lamichhane struck Tom Banton out lbw off his first ball, and maintained a characteristically low economy rate of 6.25 per over. Nandan Yadav had 2 for 25 in three, and Airee had 2 for 23 in three.\nNepal took regular wickets, but this failed to keep the score down because they also gave away too many easy balls that were punished ruthlessly by the English batsmen.\nSome of the decisions were a little questionable. All-rounder Kushal Bhurtel bowled out all of his four overs and went for 40 runs, taking no wickets \u2014 surely Airee or Yadav would have fared better.\nAnd opting for spin in the last over would have been a brave choice, but perhaps the correct one, given that Karan KC went for 21.\nNepal had a will-they-won\u2019t-they batting innings. Kushal Bhurtel got them off to a lovely start with 29 off 17, and Rohit Paudel\u2019s steady 39 off 34 held it all together.\nAiree shone again with 44 off 29, further cementing his importance in the team. Lokesh Bam\u2019s 39 off 20 almost brought the team back from an impossible position. Young Gulshan Jha was disappointing with 1 off 2. The ball he got bowled out, the last ball of the second-to-last over was very hittable, and would have made the last over much easier.\nVeteran fast bowler Jofra Archer and spinner Adil Rashid got hit hard around the pitch. Left-arm spinner Liam Dawson and Sam Curran were excellent, giving away only 21 and 27 runs off their four overs, taking a wicket each.\nEngland were visibly relieved at the end, and Nepal heartbroken at having come so close to what would have been the nation\u2019s greatest ever sporting moment.\nBut the loss should not take nothing away from the magnitude of the performance. It was still surreal seeing Nepal competing at the largest stage against the mighty Brits. Nepali fans packed the stands, having traveled on planes and automobiles to support their team, decked out in the stands with Nepali flags and Dhaka Topi.\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t easy at all, thankfully we got over the line. They put us in a tricky situation. I thought we were in a very good position to defend that, didn\u2019t think it would go as close,\u201d said Brooks post match.\n\u201cResult-wise, it didn\u2019t go our way, but effort-wise, 100% on fielding, bowling and batting. I think we\u2019ll improve from there. Teams in this tournament will not take any teams lightly. The fans are very passionate,\u201d summed up Nepal captain Rohit Paudel.\nThe performance further vindicated the controversial decision to have a twenty-team world cup. Ex-Indian spinner Ravichandran Ashwin, for one, had thought that the format would lead to too many one-sided matches, resulting in low viewership.\nBut Nepal against England was the third impressive showing in only two days by an associate nation, after The Netherlands and The USA scared stalwarts Pakistan and India on Saturday.\nThe team's performance on Sunday will also positively make the next season of the Nepal Premier League more marketable as well as bring bigger names having seen Nepal perform exceptionally well internationally against better teams.\nNepal now stand third in Group C, after The West Indies beat Scotland on Saturday by 35 runs. Italy are yet to play. They are Nepal\u2019s next opponents, on 12 February.\nThe math now is pretty simple. Only the top two teams progress past the group stage.

{"title": "Java in the Himalaya", "tag": null, "content": "The seriesNepal Madeprofiles world-class Nepali products and the people behind them.\nThe Dutch colonised Indonesian island of Java in 1596, and found that the coffee plant thrived in its fertile volcanic soil. Java had become the primary source of coffee for the world by 1720, and the place name became synonymous with the beverage.\nFour hundred years later, in Kathmandu an entrepreneur named Gagan Pradhan founded Himalayan Java Coffee. After returning from Australia in 1990, he found that opening a caf\u00e9 was the most affordable investment.\nNow, 27 years later, there are 100 Java franchises in the Kathmandu Valley, Pokhara, Kurintar, Itahari and even Toronto and Lhasa.\nThe story of Himalayan Java is pioneering, yet simple, combining consistent delivery in tastefully designed cafes at strategic locations to create a juggernaut of a brand. New Javas seem to pop up exactly where you would expect them to.\n\u201cIt all started as a passion, a hobby, and I never expected this venture to spread so widely so rapidly,\u201d founder Pradhan told us at the Thamel outlet, where Himalayan Java moved in 2000 after opening the first small caf\u00e9 in Kamaladi.\nLocated on the first floor of a North Face showroom opposite Fire & Ice Pizzeria in Thamel, the cafe has seating overlooking the street, and a spacious, bright indoors that is packed with locals, tourists, furniture, staff, baked goods on display, Himalayan Java merch, and coffee paraphernalia.\nOn a recent Friday afternoon, there were Nepalis, tourists from India and China in groups and solo, and monks in maroon. Westerners lounged on sofas, focused intensely on their laptops with headphones on. On an isolated balcony corner, two UML cadre could be overheard planning a campaign rally for the March election.\nCUSTOMER SATISFACTION\nNearby in Darbar Marg is another Himalayan Java on the top floor of a building overlooking Narayanhiti Palace. On Mandala Street up a flight of stairs and in JP Marg is another Java outlet. That makes four outlets within a 400m circle in Kathmandu.\nOver in Patan, the density of locations is even higher: within 1sq km in the Sanepa-Jhamsikhel- Pulchok area are eight Himalayan Java outlets.\nHimalayan Java\u2019s franchise business model is unique for Nepal: there is no other food or beverage business that has pulled it off on this scale.\n\u201cWe want Java to become a part of the customers\u2019 life, as a casual place to meet or rest,\u201d says General Manager Diwakar Ojha, explaining that an interested party applies, is vetted and can buy a franchise for a certain location. The criteria is whether the franchise has the resources and capacity to handle running the outlet long-term.\nThe investor must follow rules and regulations to ensure quality of the product, standard of service and interior d\u00e9cor. But the management, marketing, staffing and supply chain are all handled by Himalayan Java which charges a franchise fee and a percentage of sales.\nSome investors are prolific \u2013 there is one in Kathmandu who opened three franchises in two years. The outlets have a common ambience, but each location has its own unique vibe as well.\n\u201cSame same, but different. We put a lot of thought into it,\u201d Ojha says. \u201cWe are careful about location, and getting the design and feel of the cafe to gel with the surroundings. We integrate core things like furniture, bar counters, colours, but each one is unique.\u201d\nA key value of the brand is consistency, and the main challenge is managing the supply chain. There are sister companies under the Himalayan Java brand: The Bakery, Bakery School, Roastery, Barista School, Import and Export, and Brewshala, where coffees and drinks are trialed and experimented.\nThe hub of the operation is the Roastery and the Bakery in Bluebird Mall from where all beans and baked goods are sent to the outlets. Java now also has its own coffee farm in Ilam, and the rest of the beans are sourced from the Nepal Coffee Company, and it sells only Nepali coffee sourced from small farmers.\nJava has also evolved into co-working and lounge-type spaces where customers can meet, explore and follow social media trends like Matcha the green-tea based beverage that Java modified into the popular Blended Matcha, a Matcha Latte, and a Strawberry Matcha drink.\nHimalayan Java Coffee recently received a large investment from NIBL Equity Partners who acquired a 28.8% stake opening the way for more expansion (pictured). Plans are afoot to open more franchises across Nepal and in New Delhi.\nDespite its popularity, one criticism is the price point. An Americano can cost up to Rs355. Ojha justifies this saying the price reflects the high overheads.\nOne solution is Himalayan Java Express, designed much more pragmatically, mainly for to-go orders where drink prices are slashed by half.", "url": "https://nepalitimes.com/here-now/java-in-the-himalaya-y1ilc21h", "scraped_at": "2026-02-13T21:53:39.631876"}
{"title": "T20 World Cup 2026 curtain raiser", "tag": null, "content": "In the 2024 edition, Nepal\u2019s Rhinos surprised fans with outstanding performances against established cricketing nations such as South Africa and Bangladesh, ultimately crashing out of the competition with just one point.\nThe team has matured since. It is a more settled, confident squad, still young. Two seasons of the Nepal Premier League means that key players have spent more time leading, performing, making decisions in high pressure T20 scenarios. The tournament has also created many more Nepali cricket fans, which means the team will also be playing to visiting Nepalis and the home crowd on live feeds of the matches at the 2026 T20 World Cup this month.\nAnd the historic 2-1 series victory over the West Indies in September 2025 means that the players know they can compete at the highest level. England, Italy, West Indies and Scotland are the other nations in Nepal\u2019s Group C, and none of those teams will be going into their matches against Nepal expecting an easy victory.\nThe team also won all of its games in the qualifiers for this tournament, and comfortably defeated the UAE in a warm-up match on Tuesday. Nepal seems to be in a buffer zone between being an associate nation and at the level of Full ICC members like Ireland, at least in T20 cricket. This tournament will be the test.\nAfter a further warmup game against Canada on 6 February, Nepal play heavyweights England two days later at the Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai, before the much easier contest against Italy on 12 February. The Wankhede is usually friendly to batters.\nThen the team plays the West Indies on Valentine\u2019s Day, and Scotland two days later. The Windies team this time will be a much stronger one than the one Nepal beat in the series. After all, they have won this trophy twice.\nEden Gardens is traditionally spin-friendly later in matches. Which is good news for Nepal\u2019s bowling attack, especially the pair of leg-spinner Sandeep Lamichhane and left-arm orthodox Lalit Rajbhanshi who will be important in the middle innings, to bring down the run rate and take wickets after the powerplay overs are done.\nDipendra Singh Airee is an important cog. While his batting is a little inconsistent, Airee barely gives away any runs with the ball and gets important breakthroughs from the field. His skills were on full display in the warm up match against the UAE: 1/12 from three overs with the ball, a signature direct hit runout, and most importantly a 50 off 31 to stablise the innings with Aarif Sheikh after the top three were sent back underwhelmingly.\nThis strong top three of openers Kushal Bhurtel and Aasif Sheikh, and captain Rohit Poudel will be crucial to Nepal\u2019s success. If two out of the three can do well in a particular game then the team has a great chance of putting up or chasing down a high score.\nGulshan Jha, 19, will play the critical finisher role in the later overs. Jha chases boundaries from the first ball he faces and reliably gets, say, 18 off 8. If he can figure out how to turn this into 35 off 16, then Nepal would be defending scores in the 160s or 170s instead of the 140s -- a huge mental difference.\nA unique thing about the Nepali squad is how many all-rounders there are. Airee is the sixth best T20 all-rounder in the world as per ICC rankings. Bhurtel, Paudel, Aarif Sheikh, Karan KC, Gulshan Jha and Sompal Kami are all fixtures in the starting lineup and they can all bat and bowl.\nThis gives the team many options to throw at the opposition\u2019s batting attack, even though perhaps in the long term the team would be better off if most of these players focused on their main skill.\nAnother strength is Nepal\u2019s fielding. Catching standards have drastically improved in this young Nepali side coming into its prime. Avoiding dropped catches is also important for in-game momentum and morale. The top two teams from each group go through.\nFor Nepal to get through, a realistic scenario would be to beat Italy and Scotland, the first easy, the second competitive but very possible. Scotland are in the tournament only because Bangladesh were kicked out over refusing to play in India over security concerns.\nThey would also have to win against either West Indies or England, which would be a major statement to the cricketing world. With a bit of luck, West Indies seems the more likely upset, and England might just feel the pressure of the opening match and of being the heavy favourite.\nWith matches in neighbouring India, a lot of in-stadium support is expected at the games. A strong performance at the competition would help in keeping Nepali cricket on its current upward trajectory.", "url": "https://nepalitimes.com/news/t20-world-cup-2026-curtain-raiser", "scraped_at": "2026-02-13T21:53:41.951249"}

If cleverly promoted, the international demand for Nepali coffee can be 8,000 tons.\n\u201cCoffee is all about story-telling,\u201d explainsGagan Pradhan, founder of Himalayan Java Coffee. \u201cNepali coffee has brand value because it is grown in the highest elevations on earth and is a cash crop for cooperatives and small farmers. There is tremendous potential for growth.\u201d\nThe reason for the decline in coffee production lately is attributed to erratic weather caused by climate change, but mostly it is because it is manual-intensive, needing initial capital and patience for a return on investment.\nThe strategy that makes most sense forNepal\u2019s coffee industryis to sell it as a rare, specialty product.\nSays Raj Kumar Banjara, master trainer at Nepal Coffee Academy and originator of the Himalayan Arabica brand: \u201cThere is no better crop for Nepal because we have the ideal soil and weather to grow specialty coffee, which can be exported to third countries directly instead of sending it through India like with ginger, cardamom, or tea.\u201d\nThese favorable conditions are at altitudes between 800m to 1,600m along the mid-mountains and temperature not exceeding 22\u00b0C, which allows cherries to \u00a0develop slower, giving it a denser taste with complex flavours of fruits and nuts.\nThis is \u2018Arabica\u2019 coffee, and it is also considered \u2018organic by default\u2019 because farmers have limited access to chemical pesticides and fertilisers, adding to its premium.\nAll of Nepal\u2019s coffee is grown in only 4,300 hectares total, and this is just 0.36% of the area suitable for coffee farming. Still 31,000 households across 44 districts depend on this cash crop.\nChallenges include out-migration, limits on land ownership, and climate breakdown leading to colder, drier winters, droughts and heat stress.\nShreeyanch Shrestha is the founder of Samparka Cloud Loyalty, a startup that helps businesses retain customers by giving them insights about customer behaviour. Among the services offered is a digital loyalty card for coffee shops, one of his biggest clientele.\nShrestha is also a coffee enthusiast, and recently collaborated with Baato Maps on the playfully designed \u2018Kathmandu Coffee Map\u2019.\n\u201cThis was a marketing campaign but also a way to pay tribute to cafe owners we worked with,\u201d he says. \u201cA new generation of coffee farmers, processors, roasters and consumers seem to want to invest in upgrading their coffee experience.\u201d\nCOFFEE CULTURE\nOperators such as Raj Kumar Banjara have been in that game for over 30 years, even earning a PhD in Coffee Agriculture, running farms and teaching roasting and barista courses. Now, he makes short how-to videos on social media. Banjara\u2019s Academy is run by Specialty Coffee Association certified Q Graders and Authorised Trainers.\nAlso promoting a coffee culture through social media is Santosh Shah of Bariko Coffee. He documents his process on Instagram, from hand picking and processing coffee cherries to brewing.\nNepal appears to be riding the Third Wave of Coffee (see box) as the beverage moves away from the caf\u00e9 chain culture to one that values knowledge of the cherries, beans, the roasting process and brewing -- right from the plant to the cup.\nAlong the way, there are tales to be told about where the coffee is grown, who grows it, and how farmers get a fair price for the product. Coffee then becomes a shared social experience that directly connects the consumer to the producer.\nNima Tenzing Sherpa returned to Nepal from the United States to start Lekali Coffee Estate in 2018, and produces fine single origin coffee beans so that the quality of the product improves the quality of life of the growers.\nHe told Nepali Times: \u201cSpecialty-grade beans are the only future for Nepal\u2019s coffee industry. I am continuously hunting for the best coffee origins in Nepal.\u201d\nHISTORY OF COFFEE\nHuman consumption of coffee began in Ethiopia when herders found their goats became perky after eating beans from a wild Arabica bush. The first commercial cultivation of the brew began in Yemen 600 years ago.\nNepal\u2019s coffee history is much younger. A holy man is said to have brought coffee seeds from Burma in 1938, and planted them in Gulmi, the district in the mid-mountains where the first coffee nursery was set up in 1981.\nThe Nepal Coffee Company was founded in 1983 by Krishna Ghimire in Manigram near Butwal which educated farmers about the crop and recruited them to cultivate it. He then roasted the beans, and convinced the BhatBhateni stores, which had just opened, to sell it.\nThe company still supplies coffee to cafes and has its own brands and farm. It supplies green beans to those who want to self-roast, or build a brand.\nIn the 1990s, the National Tea and Coffee Development Board was established, and Himalayan Java Coffee (Nepal Made, right) opened its first shop in Kamaladi before moving to Thamel. Itr now has nearly 100 franchises across Nepal and overseas.\nWhat is the Third Wave?\nFirst Wave: Profit-driven, mass marketing, air tight containers and instant coffee. Consumption of coffee worldwide starts growing.\nSecond Wave: Artisan-driven, origin and roasting style become important, epitomised by Starbucks and espresso.\nThird Wave: Characteristics of the beverage take centre stage: origin of the beans, consistent processing techniques, and roasting style. Independent coffee shops demonstrate craftsmanship and knowledge of coffee beans from plant to the cup, promoting ethics and transparency.\nCoffee Districts\nCoffee is grown in over 44 districts of Nepal (see map, above). In the last fiscal year, Nepal produced 550 tonnes of Bourbon, Typica and Yellow Caturra varieties of Arabica coffee. The total plantation area in Nepal is 4,300 hectares, a fraction of the total suitable land.", "url": "https://nepalitimes.com/here-now/caffeine-buzz", "scraped_at": "2026-02-13T21:53:44.195735"}

In some cases, even the rescues were said to be fake with false names of \u2018patients\u2019 and their ailments.\nThe six who were arrested were charged by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CIB) withcheating insurance companiesof millions of dollars in the past four years with more than 300fake chopper medevacsfrom the base of Himalayan peaks to hospitals in Kathmandu.\nNepali personnel of three companies, Nepal Charter Service, Everest Experience and Mountain Rescue were accused of heavily overcharging \u00a0for fraudulent rescues, faking or inflating medical bills, and claiming payment of over $18 million over the years, the CIB said.\nIn some cases, trekkers themselves who do not want to walk back along the same trail to Everest Base Camp or other routes, and pretend to be sick, are also said to be involved in the scam.\n\u201cTourism will attract opportunists, that is true everywhere,\u201d explains Raj Gyawali ofsocialtoursand a partner ofEthical Travel Portal. \u201cOur responsibility as an industry is to weed them out, protect what matters, and keep tourism rooted in passion, integrity, and long-term value.\u201d\nThe scam gotwide international attention, and tainted the reputation of Nepal\u2019s mountain tourism sector that employs up to 1 million people. International media headlined allegations that trekker food was spiked to cause diarrhoea to force evacuations.\nDespite the bad publicity, tourism operators see a silver lining. It shows that Nepal is cleaning up its act and the system is working. Besides, the cheaters are in a minority in an industry that provides some of the best organised and most experienced mountain tourism service in the world.\n\u201cAfter years of talk and investigation, we are now seeing arrests and it\u2019s encouraging to finally see action. This didn\u2019t happen overnight,\u201d Gyawali says. \u201cThe post GenZ interim government works with much less politics, we are seeing a functional system for the first time in decades in Nepal.\u201d\nThis is not a new story.Nepali Times first coveredtrekking insurance scams in 2013, following up on an investigation by the British Mountaineering Council inSummit magazineabout insurance fraud involving fake helicopter rescues.\nInanother news itempublished in this paper in 2018 cited an investigation by insurance watchdogTraveller Assistwhich showed that a third of the 1,600 helicopter rescues in Nepal that year were fraudulent, costing up to $4 million. Insurance companies gave the Nepal governmentan ultimatumto clean up its act, and an investigation committee was formed and 13 companies said to be involved were named.\nIt now looks like although insurance fraud declined, it was still continuing to some extent till 2025. In the cut-throat competition in Nepal\u2019s mountain tourism industry, companies undercut each other, and there are some trying to make a quick buck. These rotten apples spoil the whole barrel.\nGiven Nepal\u2019s remote terrain and extreme weather along Himalayan trekking routes, helicopter rescues are vital in saving hundreds of lives every year, rescuing trekkers and mountaineers suffering from acute mountain sickness, stomach or lung infections.\n\u201cNepal has a unique advantage over other Himalayan countries like India, Pakistan, or China because it allows private helicopter companies to conduct rescues,\u201d Gyawali says. \u201cThis makes rescues faster and more accessible, often life-saving.\u201d\nThe real problem is that sometimes rescues take too long because of \u00a0permission needed from multiple government agencies to conduct rescues near the Chinese border, which is considered sensitive.
