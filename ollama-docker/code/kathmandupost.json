{ "title": "Pressure mounts to ready parliament building as House election nears", "tag": "National", "content": "The scheduled March 5 election is just over a month away and the results will be out within the next fortnight. However, it remains unclear whether the Parliament building will be ready in time for lawmakers to take oath.\nThe Gallery Baithak on the Singha Durbar premises housed the country\u2019s Parliament from the time of the first parliamentary elections in 1959 until the reinstatement of the House in 2006. The House that was reinstated after the second people\u2019s movement, which saw the rebel Maoists represented for the first time, also functioned from the same building.\nHowever, a significant rise in the number of representatives in the Constituent Assembly in 2008, to 601, left the Gallery Baithak short of space. As a result, the Birendra International Convention Centre at New Baneshwar was chosen. Both constituent assemblies and the two federal parliaments, following the promulgation of Nepal's 2015 Constitution, operated from the convention centre.\nThe property was leased by the government, which paid nearly Rs150 million in annual rent. The lease agreement has not been renewed following an arson incident that rendered the property uninhabitable.\nThe parliament building was the first target of the September Gen Z movement. It was completely destroyed on September 9. With each passing day, the Parliament Secretariat and the government are under intense pressure to secure an alternative venue before the new House is elected.\nOfficials believe the under-construction buildings on the Singha Durbar premises will be ready. \u201cAmid uncertainties, we wrote to the government to make a place available on time for the newly elected House,\u201d Eakram Giri, spokesperson for the secretariat, told the Post. \u201cThe Ministry of Urban Development has assured that the new space will be ready in a month and a half.\u201d\nAfter operating the legislature from the rented building for a decade, the government began construction of dedicated facilities in 2019. The foundation stone for the 12 structures was laid in September that year, with a target completion date of three years. The joint venture of the China-based Second Harbour Engineering Company and Tundi Construction, a Nepali firm, won the contract.\nHowever, even after missing the fifth deadline extension in the past three years, the construction remains incomplete.\nOfficials overseeing the construction say work has been expedited to prepare the space to accommodate both chambers of parliament. \u201cThe entire structure will not immediately be ready, but the chambers for both houses and a lobby connecting them will be ready by mid-February at the latest,\u201d Roshan Shrestha, the project chief, told the Post.\nThe under-construction area, spread over 150 ropani (7.63 hectares), has been designed to accommodate 700 individuals in the chamber designated for the lower house. It will have a seating capacity of 400 for lawmakers on the main floor and 300 in the balcony for the press, visitors, and guests. The hall designated for the 59-strong National Assembly will have seating arrangements for over 250.\nA separate hall with 350 seats is also under construction for the joint meeting of the two houses. Shrestha said that while the civil works, which involve the erection of the structure, have been completed, the interiors and the installation of the dome at the top remain incomplete.\n\u201cWe have mobilised 406 people daily to complete interiors and the roofing. The production of chairs is going on simultaneously,\u201d he said. \u201cAll the items related to information technology have been imported, which await installation.\u201d\nThere is a constitutional compulsion to call the session within 30 days of the final results of the election to the House of Representatives. The session was called 50 days after the elections in November 2022, as the Election Commission took more than two weeks to announce the final results.\nIf the commission\u2019s plan works, counting will be completed in less than a week, as only HoR votes need to be counted, unlike in the previous elections when provincial assembly polls were held simultaneously. Preparations of the final results will take another few days, the commission says.\nIf the commission faces no obstacle in conducting the elections, the House session needs to be called by mid-March.\n\u201cWe need the space ready at least three weeks before the first meeting to make sure everything is functional. As it is the new place, we also need to conduct mock drills in advance,\u201d said Giri. \u201cThe secretariat believes the government and the construction companies understand the sensitivity.\u201d", "url": "https://kathmandupost.com/national/2026/01/31/pressure-mounts-to-ready-parliament-building-as-house-election-nears", "scraped_at": "2026-01-31T14:35:01.178712" },
{ "title": "Nepal issues Nipah testing guidelines amid India outbreak", "tag": "Health", "content": "Amid growing concern over the current Nipah virus outbreak in West Bengal, India, and rising fear and testing demands, Nepal\u2019s Epidemiology and Disease Control Division has issued an interim testing guideline for suspected cases.\nAs per thenew protocol, suspected Nipah cases are people whose health is rapidly deteriorating or who have died, and who show symptoms such as fever with breathing difficulties or coma. The protocol states that such persons must also have an epidemiological link, such as drinking raw date palm sap, contact with infected animals, particularly fruit bats, and have a history of travelling in the Nipah endemic areas.\nProbable Nipah cases include deaths, severe acute respiratory infections, or cases of acute encephalitis, and anyone who has been in contact with confirmed Nipah patients.\n\u201cDozens of people, including those who have recently travelled to India\u2019s West Bengal and are experiencing influenza-like symptoms, have been contacting us for testing,\u201d said an official at the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division, asking not be named, as he is not authorised to speak to the media.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t need to panic, as Indian health authorities and the World Health Organisation have informed us that the outbreak has been successfully contained, and the risk of spread is not high even though Nepal shares a land border with West Bengal.\u201d\nNipah is a zoonotic virus that is transmitted from animals to humans. But Nipah is far deadlier than the coronavirus that wrought havoc worldwide for years since its outbreak in 2019. India confirmed two cases of Nipah virus infection this month in the state of West Bengal.\nInfected patients are healthcare workers, who showed symptoms in the last week of December last year, according to the UN health body.\nTransmission generally occurs when people come in direct contact with infected animals or consume their meat. But cases of human-to-human transmission of the virus have also been reported in many places, including in India, among the families and caregivers of the infected people.\nPublic health experts say Nepal is at risk of a Nipah virus outbreak, as fruit bats, the virus's primary hosts, may also be present in Nepal. West Bengal borders Nepal\u2019s Koshi province, where hundreds of people cross daily.\nOfficials say that health workers have been asked to admit suspected Nipah cases to hospitals designated as coronavirus treatment centres in the past, with respiratory and contact precautions (personal protective equipment).\n\u201cWe are also working to prepare a treatment guideline,\u201d said the officials.\nEarlier, the disease control body had directed hospitals nationwide to report sudden patient deaths and patients exhibiting Nipah virus-like symptoms. Health desks at the land crossings and Tribhuvan International Airport have been alerted to the possible arrival of a Nipah virus case and have directed health workers to remain vigilant.\nThe World Health Organisation says that people infected with the Nipah virus typically develop symptoms within 3 to 14 days, with fever, headache, cough, sore throat, and difficulty breathing. Some people may also experience brain swelling or encephalitis, where severe symptoms can include confusion, drowsiness and seizure. In some cases, patients can fall into a coma within 24 to 48 hours.\nThe disease has a fatality rate of 40\u201370 percent, according to the UN health body.\nThe Nipah virus was first detected in 1999, after farmers and others who came into close contact with infected pigs in Malaysia and Singapore developed severe respiratory problems and brain inflammation. According to the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, nearly 300 people were diagnosed with the disease then, and more than 100 of them died.\nIndia\u2019s West Bengal recorded the deadliest Nipah virus outbreak in 2001, in which 66 people were infected, and 45 of them died. The virus resurfaced in 2007 when five people were infected, and all died.\nThe virus claimed17 livesin Kerala, India, in 2018. Between 2018 and 2025, outbreaks were reported almost annually in Kerala. The deadly virus hasresurfacedin West Bengal after a 19-year gap, according to media reports.\nSo far, India documented the seventh Nipah outbreak\nExperts said that authorities should take the issue seriously as the virus is far deadlier than the coronavirus, with up to a 70 percent death rate in humans.\nDoctors say that fruit bats from India, which carry the Nipah virus, can easily enter Nepal due to the proximity and similar environments. Moreover, there is a high likelihood that any disease seen in India will enter Nepal due to the free movement of people between the two countries, doctors say.\nThe World Health Organisation said that although the virus has caused only a few known outbreaks in Asia, it infects a wide range of animals and causes severe disease and death in people, making ita public health concern.\nDoctors say most Nipah virus symptoms overlap with those of other common viruses, including the coronavirus, increasing the risk of misdiagnosis.\nThere is no treatment for the Nipah virus at present. Health workers provide only symptomatic treatment, according to them.", "url": "https://kathmandupost.com/health/2026/01/30/nepal-issues-nipah-testing-guidelines-amid-outbreak-in-india", "scraped_at": "2026-01-31T14:35:01.433157" },

{"title":"Teams seek development at SAFF U19 Women’s Championship","tag":"Football","content":"Nepal are contending for their first title at the under-age tournament of the South Asian Football Federation in the SAFF U19 Women’s Championship, kicking off between four teams at Pokhara Stadium on Saturday.\nThe visiting teams include defending champions India and Bangladesh, alongside Bhutan.\nThe 2024 edition of the SAFF U19 Women’s Championship, hosted by Bangladesh between the same four teams, saw India and Bangladesh crowned the joint champions after an 11-11 penalty score after a 1-1 draw, and aprotestfrom the hosts and fans after India were initially declared the winner based on a coin toss.\nOf the six under-age SAFF Women’s Championships since the inaugural U18 tournament in 2018, Bangladesh and India have won the U18 category once each in 2018 and 2022, respectively. Bangladesh were the champions in both the U20 category events in 2023 and 2025, alongside the U19 category in 2021.\nMeanwhile, despite emerging victorious in five of the last six under-age SAFF Women’s events, Bangladesh head coach Peter Butler, during the pre-tournament conference of the SAFF U19 Women’s Championship in Pokhara on Friday, said he was not here for the title.\n“My main priority is not to come here and win this tournament,” said Butler, who is also the head coach of the Bangladesh women’s senior team. “My main priority is to come here and continue the development pipeline, which has actually served us well over the last two years I’ve been here.”\nIt was under Buttler that Bangladesh won the 2024 SAFF Women’s Championship, defeating Nepal at Dasharath Stadium in October.\n“Hopefully, we can do what we aim to do, which is to continue our development. And I stress the word ‘development’ as this is a development tournament,” Butler added. “And this is all geared towards moving forward for these young players onto a bigger stage, which is under-20s SAFF and AFC tournaments, and seniors.”\nAccording to Butler, his main focus in the U19 event will be to identify and assess young players who can go and play on the bigger stage.\n“I think challenges are great, that’s what development is all about. If you don’t have challenges, you don’t have hurdles, you don’t really test yourself,” he said. “We are here to do our best, and be our competitive and authentic selves. The most important thing I ask them is to be true, hardworking, competitive, and show what they can do.”\nSimilarly, Pamela Conti, the 43-year-old Italian who was appointed the head coach of India’s U17 women’s team around a week ago, said that she wanted her team to learn from the SAFF U19 Championship.\n“Our U17 team has come here to participate in the U19 tournament,” Conti said. “But we will be giving our best against the other teams with more experienced players.”\n“This tournament is important for experience for our young players so that they understand the discipline and sacrifice to stay in this tournament and improve our football like European football,” Conti said in Pokhara. “This is important for the system.”\nRather than the SAFF tournament, Conti has joined India for a bigger tournament. India’s U17 team are playing in the AFC U17 Women’s Asian Cup, which is taking place in April-May in China this year.\nSimilarly, Julan Nongmaithem, skipper of the team, said, “We are all from the U17 team, but we are confident to give our best. Our preparation is going well. We have good cooperation and support each other.”\nNonetheless, head coach Conti and skipper Nongmaithem stressed that they would try not to lose any of the matches. “I have watched some matches of Nepal, and I think they are a good team,” Conti said. “And we need to give our best to win tomorrow because the first game is always hard for everybody.”\nNepal’s head coach Suman Shrestha argued that the tournament is a good platform to test the might of the grassroots. “This tournament is important for the development of grassroots football in the women’s category,” he said.\n“Though we will not be taking the tournament lightly,” continued Shrestha, “we are focusing on a bigger picture.”\nHowever, the way the All Nepal Football Association (ANFA) has been rotating the coaching role for the under-age category, it does not feel that the governing body of Nepali football has taken the development of grassroots football seriously. During the 2024 SAFF U19 Women’s Championship, the head coachwasBal Gopal Sahukhala.\nShrestha said that many of the former U17 players are in his squad. Nepal’s squad has been training for over three weeks for the tournament.\n“We have trained well,” Nepal’s U19 skipper Sushila KC said. “We will show our abilities on the field rather than talking here.”\nOn the other hand, Bhutan’s head coach Tanka Maya Ghalley said that her team comprises former U17 and U19 players alongside some new faces.\nGhalley, who was the head coach of the Bhutan team during the 2024 SAFF U19 Women’s Championship as well, said that Bhutan was investing in grassroots football for the future.\n“Our grassroots football investment is not only about results, but giving opportunities for the team to inspire a new generation of women’s football in Bhutan,” said Ghalley. “So that we can have better results in the future.”\nThe tournament will be played in a single round-robin format, with the top two teams playing in the final for the title.","url":"https://kathmandupost.com/football/2026/01/30/teams-seek-development-at-saff-u19-women-s-championship","scraped_at":"2026-01-31T14:35:02.166124"}
